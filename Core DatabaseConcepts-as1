You have to design a movie recommendation database.
Movies have two attributes: id, title. A possible movie record is as follows: 54796, 2 Days in Paris (2007).
A movie can be categorized into multiple genres. A movie may not have a genre.
A user can give a 5-star scale rating (1-5) to a movie. A user can only rate a movie once. Log each rating operation.
A user can also assign a tag to a movie (multiple times). Log each tagging operation.

Schema:
  users - table of users
    userid - Primary Key, serial
    name - char(50), Not Null
  movies - table of movies
    movieid - Primary Key, serial
    title - varchar(), Not Null
